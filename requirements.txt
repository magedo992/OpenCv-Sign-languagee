1. OpenCV: This is a computer vision library that provides functions for image and video processing, including capturing live video frames from a camera. You can install OpenCV using pip install opencv-python.

2. MediaPipe: This is a machine learning framework from Google that provides pre-built models and pipelines for various tasks, including hand tracking and pose estimation. You can install MediaPipe using pip install mediapipe.

3. TensorFlow: This is a popular deep learning framework that provides tools and libraries for building and training neural networks. You can install TensorFlow using pip install tensorflow.

4. NumPy: This is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for handling multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical operations. You can install NumPy using pip install numpy.

Please make sure to install these dependencies in your Python environment before running the code. Additionally, you may need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

It's worth noting that the code assumes you have a pre-trained model file (model.p) and a dataset file (data.pickle) available. You will need to provide the actual paths to these files in your code or ensure that they are in the same directory as your script.
